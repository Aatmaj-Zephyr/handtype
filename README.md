## Aim

**To convert text to handwriting in a seemingly authentic manner. To achieve a realistic conversion of typed text into handwritten-style content, creating a genuine vintage appearance through deep learning techniques, commonly referred to as 'deep faking.'**

<br>

**Example -**

## Getting started with HandType

- Step 1: make your handwriting font at https://www.calligraphr.com/en/
- Step 2: Load font ttf file in colab
- Step 3: Load an old paper image (the more dirty, the more real it looks)
- Step 4: Enter the text you want
- Step 5: Set the fint size
- Step 6: Adjust the line spacing according to the line spacing in the paper
- Step 7: Download the image. Enjoy!
- Step 8: Star this repository and follow me on githubüòá

## ‚öí Lint

This repository ensures the quality of Jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by integrating a linting process using GitHub Actions. Here's a brief overview of how it works and why it's essential:

### Overview

Jupyter notebooks, while extremely versatile, pose a challenge when it comes to maintaining code quality. They intermingle code, output, and markdown in a JSON format, which makes traditional Python linting tools incompatible with `.ipynb` files out of the box.

To address this challenge, we use a tool called `nbqa`. `nbqa` acts as a bridge, allowing us to run popular Python linting tools, like `flake8`, directly on Jupyter notebooks.

### How It Works

1. **Setting Up Locally**: Before pushing to the repository, you can check for linting errors locally. To do this, ensure you have `nbqa` and `flake8` installed:

   ```bash
   pip install nbqa flake8
   ```

   With the tools installed, you can lint your notebooks:

   ```bash
      nbqa flake8 handtype.ipynb
   ```

This command will highlight any linting errors in your notebook based on PEP-8 standards.

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**: Every time you push your changes or create a pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically run the linting checks on all notebooks in the repository. This process ensures that any new or modified notebooks adhere to our coding standards.

### Why It's Important

Linting provides several benefits:

- Consistency: It ensures a uniform coding style across notebooks, which is especially important in collaborative projects.
- Error Reduction: Linting helps catch and reduce errors, leading to more reliable notebooks.
- Best Practices: Linting encourages adherence to best practices, resulting in better and more readable code.

We strongly encourage all contributors to run the linting checks locally before pushing, to ensure faster integration and fewer CI build failures.

**Note:** Currently, work in progress of making the paper folded in the centre using image processing for a more faking effect. It currently is just a google collab file, but let's see what happens in the future. #goOpenSource
