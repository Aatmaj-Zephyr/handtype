## Aim

**To convert text to handwriting in a seemingly authentic manner. To achieve a realistic conversion of typed text into handwritten-style content, creating a genuine vintage appearance through deep learning techniques, commonly referred to as 'deep faking.'**

## Getting started with HandType

- Step 1: make your handwriting font at https://www.calligraphr.com/en/
- Step 2: Load font ttf file in colab
- Step 3: Load an old paper image (the more dirty, the more real it looks)
- Step 4: Enter the text you want
- Step 5: Set the fint size
- Step 6: Adjust the line spacing according to the line spacing in the paper
- Step 7: Download the image. Enjoy!

**Note:** Currently, work in progress of making the paper folded in the centre using image processing for a more faking effect. It currently is just a google collab file, but let's see what happens in the future. #goOpenSource

<h4> Happy coding!~ </h4>
